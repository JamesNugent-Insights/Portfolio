Key Insights:  
- German customers with a much higher churn rate than Spain and France (32% vs 16% avg )
- Female Customers with a higher churn rate than men (25% vs 17%)
- Positive relationship between Age and Churn rate, with a notable spike from around 50-60 yrs

### Project 2: Customer Segmentation / Python

Project Goal: To run a clustering algorthim on the dataset to see whether or not there is any clear segmentation of customers.  Average income and Score Rating were chosen as the two fields.
Clusters would be reviewed and marketing advice would be given. 

Key Insights:  
- N Clusters was set to 6
- Clusers of note were 1, 2 and 4
- Cluster 1 was labelled as 'High earner/High Spend'.  Recommendation of high ticket items and high frequency of marketing.
- Cluster 2 was labelled as 'High earner/Low Spend'.  Potential opportunity to convert these into cluster 1.  Further analysis required - Recommendation to look at other differences between cluster 1 and 2 (Gender,Age, Products)
- Cluster 4 was labelled as 'Low earner/High Spend'.  Recommendation of discounts/sale items as well as limited time offers.
